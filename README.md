# Rotate Artboard Orientation

Simple plugin for [Sketch][] to rotate the orientation of selected artboards. 

Akin to toggling between "landscape" to "portrait" orientation.
Width becomes height, height becomes width.


## How to use

1. Select one or more artboards.
1. Run the plugin.

### Usage Notes
The plugin will disregard selected items that are not artboards.



### Keyboard Shortcuts
None Assigned.




## Open Issues
Currently, an artboard might be rotated and end up overlapping another artboard on the document.

Workaround is to manually move one of the overlapping artboards.
